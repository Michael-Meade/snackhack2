# Scattered Spider

### scattered_spider.rb

The purpose of script is to take the known TLDS and keywords, which are stored in an array. These keywords are words
that members are known to use in their phishing domains.

One issue is that they are usually only up for a meager amount of time before they take it down as a way to keep researchers from viewing it. 

It takes a text file that includes possible targets and creates new domains with domians. The new domains (possible phishing domains)
are saved in an array.
